            <p>OHLOOK Performing Arts Center arrived on the scene in 2002 to bring fine arts to the DFW area through
                classes, workshops, and theatrical performances for children and adults.</p>
            <p>In the past 17 years, OHLOOK has produced over 250 productions and boasts an International award-winning
                Adult Company in addition to its National award-winning Student Company.</p>
            <p>OHLOOK is dedicated to providing the best in musical theater education, often hosting masterclasses led
                by high-caliber Broadway talent including: Anthony Rapp, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, Kait Kerrigan and
                Brian Lowdermilk, Brad Simmons, Lindsay Mendez, Corey Cott and Jay Armstrong Johnson.</p>
            <p>OHLOOK’s former students are currently performing on cruises, national tours and television shows.</p>
            <p>OHLOOK is one of a handful of theaters across the country to pilot productions for iTheatrics, the
                leading adaptor of musicals for MTI, Disney Theatricals, Tams-Witmark, Rodgers & Hammerstein and Samuel
                French.</p>
            <p>iTheatrics adapts musicals so that they can be performed by children in school programs and in
                after-school settings.</p>
            <p>iTheatrics taps outstanding theatre programs to pilot and produce these adaptations before licensing is
                made available to the public.</p>
            <p>OHLOOK was the first theater to pilot Heathers 101, Rock of Ages 101, Sister Act Jr., Freaky Friday, and
                most recently, Frozen Jr., this past summer.</p>

                        <p class="bioInfo subTitleInfo">Artistic Director & Founder</p>
                        <p class="bioInfo subInfo">Jill Blalock Lord (Artistic Director) began her professional career
                            as an opera singer, performing
                            with
                            such companies as San Francisco Opera, Ft. Worth Opera, New Jersey Opera and Augusta Opera.
                            She also
                            toured extensively across the U.S., Spain, and France singing the roles of Lucia in Lucia di
                            Lammermoor
                            and Violetta in La Traviata and Japan on the International Tour of The King and I as Tuptim,
                            starring
                            Stacy Keach as the King. Mrs. Lord’s life took a turn after the birth of her children, Emma
                            and
                            Grace.
                            Life on the road was no longer appealing, so she looked to pursue her passion closer to
                            home, and
                            thus
                            OHLOOK was born. Through OHLOOK, she hoped to create a place where students could come and
                            learn
                            about
                            theater and music in a safe, non-competitive environment, and to teach and facilitate those
                            that
                            might
                            be interested in pursuing it as a career.</p>
                        <p class="bioInfo subInfo">Now after 14 years and almost 200 shows, Mrs. Lord has had the
                            privilege to have worked with hundreds
                            of
                            students, many that are now working in the business. OHLOOK's students are on television
                            shows,
                            national
                            tours, starring in films, and recording albums. In 2011, she led her cast of Dog Sees God to
                            a
                            National
                            Title (AACTFest11) and an International Title (Liverpool International Theater Festival) for
                            Best
                            Production and was awarded Best Director at both festivals. Most recently Mrs. Lord was
                            awarded the
                            prestigious Freddie G Award for Excellence in Education at this years Junior Theater
                            Festival. It is
                            Mrs. Lord’s hope that OHLOOK will continue to be a refuge and platform for anyone interested
                            in
                            working
                            in theater for many more years to come.</p>
