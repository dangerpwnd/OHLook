            <h1>Hayden Blalock Scholarship Fund</h1>
            <p>Hayden Blalock, father of Ohlook founder, Jill Blalock Lord, passed away on November 6, 2018. He loved
                music and kids, so no surprise that he loved coming to Ohlook and watching the shows. He was always
                front row, cheering the loudest, taking horrible pictures and supporting all the students.</p>
            <p>In his honor we are starting an annual scholarship to be awarded to an Ohlook student that is pursuing
                musical theater in college. We think he would love this idea and a way to honor his memory for many
                years to come.</p>
