                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h4 class="noticeY">Do I need an appointment?</h4>
                <p>Yes. If all the appointments are full, please feel free to drop by and we will try to fit you in.</p>
                <h4 class="noticeY">What if I have conflicts with the rehearsal schedule?</h4>
                <p>If you have one or two schedule conflicts, we may be able to make accommodations in the schedule. If
                    it's more than that, especially for summer productions, you probably won't be cast because we move
                    at such a quick pace. PLEASE bring your weekly schedule and any conflicts with you to the audition.
                </p>
                <h4 class="noticeY">What's the minimum age for auditions?</h4>
                <p>All children, ages 5-18, are invited to audition. Everyone who auditions for a Sophomore, Junior or
                    Senior Production will be cast in the show! </p>
                <h4 class="noticeY">What should I bring?</h4>
                <p>You should prepare a song (sometimes we have preferences about what kind of song, noted in the
                    audition announcement), and you should bring a legible copy of the piano music for our accompanist,
                    in the key you want. <span class="noticeY">**PLEASE NOTE**</span> If you want our accompanist to
                    play your music well, do NOT bring unattached pages of sheet music. Do NOT bring a lead sheet (music
                    with only vocal lines, no piano part). You should either put your music in a three-ring binder or
                    bring a published book. Mark clearly any cuts or changes. If you're bringing a published music book,
                    please break the binding ahead of time so your music lies flat on the music stand. If you put your
                    sheet music into plastic sleeves, make sure the sleeves have a matte finish, not shiny. If you are
                    auditioning for a play, please prepare a monologue.</p>
                <h4 class="noticeY">What should I expect?</h4>
                <p>Those who audition should come prepared to read from the script provided and to sing a song of your
                    own choice. Beginners may sing any song you are comfortable singing. Advanced performers should
                    choose a song from traditional musical theatre and bring sheet music in your key. An accompanist
                    will be provided, or you make bring a recorded accompaniment on your own device (music only – no
                    vocals). We do not have a CD player, so please no CDs. Please come dressed to dance, and wear
                    appropriate, closed-toe shoes – no sandals, please! </p>
                <h4 class="noticeY">Can I sing something from the show?</h4>
                <p>The answer is almost always YES at Ohlook. Other companies often have different preferences.</p>
                <h4 class="noticeY">Do you want me to sing only 16 bars, or more than that? </h4>
                <p>Our best advice is to find a great piece of music about 32 bars, so we don't have to cut you off if
                    we're running late...</p>
                <h4 class="noticeY">Can I submit a video audition if I can't make it to the scheduled auditions?</h4>
                <p>Yes, we do accept video submissions, although we prefer you audition in person. Please email <a href="mailto:jlord@ohlookperform.com">Jill
                    Lord</a> for video submissions.</p>

                <p>If you have those, bring them. If not, it's not a problem.</p>
                <h4 class="noticeY">I've never worked with Ohlook before -- can I still get a lead?</h4>
                <p>Yes! We often give leading roles to actors who have not worked with us, and we regularly practice
                    colorblind casting.</p>

                <h2>Nervous? Don't be!</h2>
                <p>We welcome and encourage newcomers to audition for our shows. You will not be the only new person at
                    auditions. Our long-time participants will welcome you and help you feel comfortable in our group.
                    We
                    are here to have fun and make new friends, so all new people are very welcome to join us. The
                    audition
                    process is our chance to get to know you and to see what your performance skills are at this time.

                <h2>Didn't get the lead? Wait!</h2>
                <p>We encourage everyone to accept and embrace the fact that most people in our cast will be in the
                    Chorus,
                    which is great fun. You are going to learn a lot of songs, dances and get to be in a significant
                    amount
                    of the show. While you might be disappointed at first, please trust us that you will eventually have
                    a
                    great time no matter what role you play in the show. Staying in the show, even if you are
                    disappointed
                    with your role, is the best way for you to learn, grow and possibly play a larger role in a future
                    production. If you drop out because you didn’t get the role you wanted you will miss out on a lot of
                    fun
                    and special memories with good friends. We have no “stars” or “divas” at Ohlook, and we hope
                    everyone
                    who auditions will come with a cooperative, positive attitude that the show must go on! </p>
