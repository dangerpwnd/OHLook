            <li>Your place in class will NOT be confirmed until you have paid the registration fee and 1st month
                tuition.</li>
            <li>Masterclass and Production Classes are special classes that are not included in these tuition rates.
            </li>
            <li>ALL accounts will be required to have a credit/debit card on file. The card will be charged for tuition
                on the first of each month. No other form of payment will be accepted for monthly tuition. Any
                additional charges such as recital fees, costume fees, private lessons, apparel, etc., will have the
                option to be paid with cash, check, or credit card.</li>
            <li>Monthly tuition is based on an average of four classes per month. No charge is made when the fifth
                lesson occurs; however, the studio reserves the right to use these extra classes to offset classes not
                held due to holidays. The monthly fee remains the same each month regardless of the number of classes in
                that month.</li>
            <li>There are no refunds, transfers, credits or extensions for classes not taken, however, absences may be
                made up in appropriate classes at the same or lower level within six weeks of the missed class.</li>
