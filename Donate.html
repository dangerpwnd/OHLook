                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>Ohlook Performing Arts Center arrived on the scene in 2002 to bring fine arts to the DFW area through classes, workshops, and theatrical performances for children and adults. In the past 17 years, Ohlook has produced over 250 productions and boasts an International award-winning Adult Company in addition to its National award-winning Student Company. Ohlook is dedicated to providing the best in musical theater education, often hosting masterclasses led by high-caliber Broadway talent including: Anthony Rapp, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, Kait Kerrigan and Brian Lowdermilk, Brad Simmons, Lindsay Mendez, Corey Cott and Jay Armstrong Johnson. Ohlook’s former students are currently performing on cruises, national tours and television shows.</p>
                    <p>Ohlook is one of a handful of theaters across the country to pilot productions for iTheatrics, the leading adaptor of musicals for MTI, Disney Theatricals, Tams-Witmark, Rodgers & Hammerstein and Samuel French. iTheatrics adapts musicals so that they can be performed by children in school programs and in after-school settings. iTheatrics taps outstanding theatre programs to pilot and produce these adaptations before licensing is made available to the public. Ohlook was the first theater to pilot Heathers 101, Rock of Ages 101, Sister Act Jr., Freaky Friday, and most recently, Frozen Jr., this past summer.</p>
                    <h2>Jill Blalock Lord</h2>
                    <h2>Artistic Director & Founder</h2>
                    <p>Jill Blalock Lord (Artistic Director) began her professional career as an opera singer, performing with such companies as San Francisco Opera, Ft. Worth Opera, New Jersey Opera and Augusta Opera. She also toured extensively across the U.S., Spain, and France singing the roles of Lucia in Lucia di Lammermoor and Violetta in La Traviata and Japan on the International Tour of The King and I as Tuptim, starring Stacy Keach as the King.  Mrs. Lord’s life took a turn after the birth of her children, Emma and Grace. Life on the road was no longer appealing, so she looked to pursue her passion closer to home, and thus OhLook was born. Through OhLook, she hoped to create a place where students could come and learn about theater and music in a safe, non-competitive environment, and to teach and facilitate those that might be interested in pursuing it as a career.</p>
                    <p>Now after 14 years and almost 200 shows, Mrs. Lord has had the privilege to have worked with hundreds of students, many that are now working in the business. OhLook's students are on television shows, national tours, starring in films, and recording albums. In 2011, she led her cast of Dog Sees God to a National Title (AACTFest11) and an International Title (Liverpool International Theater Festival) for Best Production and was awarded Best Director at both festivals. Most recently Mrs. Lord was awarded the prestigious Freddie G Award for Excellence in Education at this years Junior Theater Festival. It is Mrs. Lord’s hope that OhLook will continue to be a refuge and platform for anyone interested in working in theater for many more years to come.</p>
