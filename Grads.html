            <h1>OhLook Graduates</h1>
            <p>Ohlook is creating a history of graduating some of the most talented students in the DFW area.  Many of our students go on to pursue a college degree in Theatre or Music at some of the finest institutions in the country.  At Ohlook we feel it is our job to encourage young talent and to help prepare them for the next step from High School level to College level.
