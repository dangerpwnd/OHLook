                <h1>OHLOOK's Masterclass</h1>
                <p>OHLOOK's three Masterclasses (Jr., Sr., OCO) are the "cream of the crop" of OHLOOK and the DFW area in terms of both talent and character. Besides the high-quality training, these students receive special performance opportunities and perks throughout the year. As leaders of OHLOOK, Masterclass students are called upon to help out with OHLOOK Productions, both as performers and behind the scenes. The OHLOOK Masterclasses have received numerous State and National Awards and invitations, many of which are displayed in the OHLOOK lobby. In the fall, all groups focus on skills and repertoire development, plus Jr., Sr., and OCO prepare for the MTI Junior Theater Festival in Atlanta, GA. In the spring, each Masterclass prepares a minimum of one production for the community. The costs for these productions are included in the Masterclass tuition.</p>
                <h2>Guidelines to be considered for Masterclass</h2>
                <p>To be considered for Masterclass you must attend our Fall auditions, Aug. 15 & 16. Please prepare, 2 contrasting songs, 16-32 bars each. You will also be asked to do a cold reading at your audition and there will be a dance audition for those that are called back. Email Jill Lord if you have questions - auditions can be scheduled through our Audition Page.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Masterclass students must be enrolled in some type of dance class at least an hour a week, either at Ohlook or at another dance studio.</li>
                    <li>Masterclass class time will include rehearsals, training and music theory.</li>
                    <li>Only 2 absences allowed during each semester (this does not include outside JTF rehearsals)</li>
                    <li>Each student is expected to accomplish 6 volunteer hours at the theater per semester. This could be passing out programs at a production, helping with a production, cleaning up, taking out the trash, organizing, etc… (there will be a sign up sheet in the office)</li>
                    <li>Any outside training or auditions must be cleared by the masterclass director.</li>
