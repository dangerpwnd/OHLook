                    <p>Calling all performers! In this exciting new camp students will work with the instructor to
                        create their own story and characters, write scenes, lyrics, and musical themes of songs. Once
                        the writing is done, the rehearsals begin. The young actors work with the director to put
                        together the show. When all the pieces come together, the result will be a performance you won’t
                        want to miss!</p>

                    <p>The Bard's most beloved comedy gets the full Seuss treatment in this playful adaptation. Two
                        madcap Narrators chronicle the tale of the mixed-up lovers as they wander through a forest full
                        of whoosh bush tush beasts and fairies dueling with bumballoon swords. Told in rhyming couplets,
                        this reimagining is how Shakespeare's magical tale might have played if Dr. Seuss had gotten his
                        hands on it. Students rehearse all week and have a performance for family and friends on the
                        last day.</p>
