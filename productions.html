                    <p>The musical Chicago is based on a play of the same name by reporter and playwright Maurine Dallas
                        Watkins, who was assigned to cover the 1924 trials of accused murderers Beulah Annan and Belva
                        Gaertner for the Chicago Tribune . In the early 1920s, Chicago's press and public became riveted
                        by the subject of homicides committed by women. Several high-profile cases arose, which
                        generally involved women killing their lovers or husbands. These cases were tried against a
                        backdrop of changing views of women in the Jazz age, and a long string of acquittals by Cook
                        County juries of women murderesses (jurors at the time were all men, and convicted murderers
                        generally faced death by hanging). A lore arose that, in Chicago, feminine or attractive women
                        could not be convicted.</p>
                    <p>The Chicago Tribune generally took a pro-prosecution "hang-them-high" stance, while still
                        presenting the details of these women's lives. Its rivals at the Hearst paperswere more
                        pro-defendant, and employed what were derisively called "sob-sisters" – women reporters who
                        focused on the plight, attractiveness, redemption, or grace of the women defendants. Regardless
                        of stance, the press covered several of these women as celebrities.</p>
