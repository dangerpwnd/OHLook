                <li>Tickets purchased on-line are e-tickets. It is not necessary to print your tickets. Simply check-in
                    at the box office.</li>
                <li class="title">What time?</li>
                <li>Doors open half an hour before a show begins. Seating is reserved.</li>
                <li class="title">Where is it?</li>
                <li>1631 W. NORTHWEST HIGHWAY IN GRAPEVINE, unless otherwise specified.</li>
                <li class="title">Are concessions available?</li>
                <li>Popcorn, snacks and beverages are available at most shows.</li>
                <li>Late night shows are BYOB, but we ask that you drink responsibly and we reserve the right to expel

                <li class="title">What's the "Splatter Zone"?</li>

                    considered "splatter zone" seating. This means you will more than likely be covered in blood. Please
                    don't sit here if you are worried about having bloody clothes or are not by nature a fun person!

        <p>Ohlook tries to provide camps and production classes that will help our students to grow - not only as
            performers but as individuals. Increasing confidence and self-esteem in our students is priority number one.
        </p>
        <p>We create a safe environment where students are never afraid to explore, fail, and succeed!</p>
    </div>
    <div id="policy" class="purchasePolicy">
        <h1 class="center purpCol">Class Payments & Policies</h1>
        <p>Refunds: All refunds will be charged a $25.00 processing fee. A full refund, minus the processing fee, will
            be given until the first day of classes. Refunds through the third week of the semester will be pro-rated,
            minus the processing fee. Once the fourth week of the semester has commenced, no refunds will be granted.
            There must be 5 students registered for the class the Thursday before the class is to commence or it will be
            canceled. If a class or camp is canceled by Ohlook the student will receive a full refund.</p>
        <h2 class="purpCol">Payment</h2>
        <p>We accept Master Card, Visa, American Express, Discover, Check, and Cash. There is a $30.00 fee for returned
            checks. For your convenience we also offer payment plans.</p>
        <p>We now offer 2 payment plans for our semester classes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plan A: Full amount up front (This discount does not apply to Production Classes. Please see below
                regarding payment policies for Production Classes.)</li>
            <li>Plan B: Monthly payments (due 1st day of class each month) - Monthly payments not received by the first
                week of the month will have a $15 late fee added to them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="purpCol">Discounts</h2>
        <p>If a student takes 2 classes or more per semester, the 2nd class and each subsequent class is eligible for a
            10% discount.</p>
        <h2 class="purpCol">Absences</h2>
        <p>If a student misses more than three performance classes in a semester, the student’s eligibility to
            participate in the final performance is at the instructor’s discretion. In extreme cases the instructor may
            choose to drop the student from the class. Students who are dropped from class due to excessive absences may
            be offered a partial refund in extenuating circumstances such as moving away from the area. Refund decisions
            will be made by the Ohlook Executive Board on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        <h2 class="purpCol">Disciplinary Action</h2>
        <p>In the rare case that a student’s behavior becomes disruptive enough that in impedes the progress of the
            class as a whole, the teacher may elect to limit the student’s participation or even remove him/her from the
            class. If a student is removed after the third week of the semester, no refund will be granted.</p>
        <h2 class="purpCol">Inclement Weather</h2>
        <p>We will not have class if GCISD is closed due to inclement weather. No refunds or make-up classes will be
            scheduled if classes are cancelled for weather related issues.</p>
        <h1 class="center purpCol">Production Class Payment & Policies</h1>
        <h2 class="purpCol">Payment</h2>
        <p>For students (high school and younger) $100 non-refundable deposit is due at the time of audition and can be
            made by check, cash or credit card. If the deposit is not paid by the last day of auditions, the performer
            will not be cast in the show. After casting has come out there are absolutely no refunds. Tuition balances
            are due by the first day of scheduled show rehearsal. After the first rehearsal, tuition will be considered
            late and subject to a $15 late fee. If full tuition has not been received by the third rehearsal (unless
            other arrangements have been made), the performer will be replaced in the production.</p>
        <h2 class="purpCol">Scheduling Conflicts</h2>
        <p>Conflicts for practices and shows must be provided by the performer at the time of audition. We will do our
            best to accommodate known conflicts, but if there are too many conflicts, the performer may want to look at
            their schedule and decide whether or not the show is a commitment they can make. After the schedule is made,
            conflicts that arise must be approved because changes made to accommodate a performer after the schedule is
            set, affects the director, cast members, performing musicians, volunteers, and parents.</p>
        <h2 class="purpCol">Behavior</h2>
        <p>Ohlook is not responsible for children left unattended before or after practice. Performers are expected to
            arrive on time and be ready to rehearse. Chronic lateness or missed practices may lead to the performer
            losing their part. Rehearsals are for learning and practicing and performers should refrain from unnecessary
            distractions and pay attention. Rehearsals are closed – please no friends at rehearsal. Performers are
            expected to be polite and respectful to all involved. Ohlook reserves the right to ask anyone to leave if
            they are not acting in the best interest of the theatre, the students, teachers or staff.</p>
        <h2 class="purpCol">Property</h2>
        <p>Costumes, props, concession items, etc., are all the property of Ohlook. Performers are not to remove
            costumes or props from the premises or help themselves to concession items. When concession items are being
            sold, students must pay for the items. Tabs or “IOUs” are not accepted.</p>
